# Dress-Up Game

This project is a browser-based dress-up game. Players can mix and match clothing,
accessories, and colors to customise a character. The game is completely
client-side and can be run locally without any build step.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Click **Play** to enter the game.
3. Use the category scroll bars to choose items and the color palette to recolor them.
4. Toggle the wind button to preview animated wind effects on skirts and dresses.

## Features

- Multiple character bases
- Clothing, accessories and color variations loaded from JSON definitions
- Music player with multiple tracks
- Optional wind animation for select garments

## Development

All assets and scripts are stored in the repository root. The game does not
require any dependencies or build tooling. Edits to the JavaScript or JSON files
will take effect after reloading `index.html`.
